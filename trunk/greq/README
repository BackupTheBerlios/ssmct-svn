Greq -- A GTK+ Shell Tool
=========================

Greq is a program that lets you build GTK+-dialogs (or requesters in AMIGA
lingo) from within a shell script. This is useful if you are writing shell
scripts that need to get input from a user by way of a GUI. If you have any
suggestions what other widgets I could implement in future versions of this
program, please drop me a line.
