0.9.4
     Added support for mnemonics in GTK+ 2.0
0.9.3
     Added detection of GTK+ 2.0
0.9.2
     Oops! I decided to change the IFS again because '\a' is an audible bell
     which is probably unexpected if output. The IFS now is '\v'. Another
     breakage results. Sorry.
0.9.1
     !!!!!ATTENTION!!!!
     Because bash collapses all occurrences of IFS whitespace, the output
     format of greq has changed in this version to use '\a' as its IFS.
     This means that all scripts that rely on prior versions will have to
     be changed. Fortunately, as this is only the second public release,
     I hope that the breakage will not be too bad ;-)
